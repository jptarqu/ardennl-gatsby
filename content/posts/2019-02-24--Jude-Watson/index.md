Amy and Dan are off again, this time to Egypt. And trouble seems to follow then here as well. No sooner than they landed in Egypt, they run into family members trying to steal their secrets and make their lives miserable. Amy and Dan struggle with their feelings toward their grandmother, Grace, who seems to have placed them in this dangerous game. Did she really love them? Just as it seemed to be the bleakest moment since they started this crazy adventure, help comes from an old friend of Garce's named Hilary, whose grandson also happens to be the guy that helped Dan and Amy earlier. Dan and Amy finally realize that Grace had been preparing them for this clue hunt since they could remember, just in her own way. Amy and Dan learn of family secrets while in Egypt. They also learn a clue from the Ekat lineage, Katherine, in one of the tombs. This leads them to their next destination, Russia, and this time they leave Nellie and Saladin behind.

There is no language or sex scenes, though Nellie flirts with someone that is excavating the tombs. There is mild family violence.    

I recommend this book for ages 10 and up.
