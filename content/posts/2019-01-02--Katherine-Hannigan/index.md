Ida B teaches children they should take care of nature. Ida is an energetic fourth grader who loves being home schooled by her parents and spending her free time talking to the trees in their apple orchard. When her mother is diagnosed with cancer, Ida B’s perfect world spins out of control. Her father sells part of their land to pay for her mother’s treatments, and Ida B is sent to the local elementary school while her mother rests and her father works. For herself, Ida B plans to hate her new school and scare away the family that plans to build a house on the purchased land. Ida B will do anything to save her friends the trees. In the end, Ida B learns that people have to take care of the earth, and that the earth sometimes takes care of people.

There is no language, sex, or violence in this book.

I recommend this book to readers of all ages.
