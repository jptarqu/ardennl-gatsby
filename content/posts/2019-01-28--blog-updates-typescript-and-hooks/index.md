Amy and Dan fly off the Russia without Nellie and Saladin. They know that this is something that they must do on their own...and maybe some help from the Holt family, especially Hamilton, the oldest Holt child. The two of them are in a search to meet up with a mysterious NNR. While in Russia, their cousin Irna gets very nervous about the children uncovering many of Russia's deepest and darkest secrets. Even Ian and Natalie Kobra are concerned-- they order Irina to take out Dan and Amy because they get too close. Dan and Amy gather clues and learn more and more about the tragic history of the last Russian Czar and his family, learning that maybe Anastasia had truly survived the blood shed with the help of Rasputin. Dan and Amy also learn to use the Holt family to help- they agreed to share their information with the Holt family as payback for helping out. Hamilton takes a lot of grief from his dad about cooperating with the enemy, but he still hold true to his promise to help for the information. Dan and Amy get to meet NNR, a descendant of Anastasia.

There is no language or sex scenes. There are intense moments with family members fighting with each other and giving order to kill.

I recommend this book for ages 10 and up.
